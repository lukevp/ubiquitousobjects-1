# Ubiquitous Objects

Ubiquitous Objects is a new type of technology that fundamentally changes how applications are built, released, maintained, and enhanced.  

It is such a departure from any application architecture that comes before it that it may, at first blush, seem impossible, or insecure, or lacking in performance.  That isn't the case, and it is entirely possible to build applications more quickly, more reliably, and more efficiently than we do today, allowing you to focus on delivering value to your users faster than ever before.

In the following guide, we will go through computing history from the beginning to present day, discuss pivotal moments in its short history where mental models and software development approaches have fundamentally shifted, and introduce the theory and philosophy of the approach Ubiquitous Objects follows.
