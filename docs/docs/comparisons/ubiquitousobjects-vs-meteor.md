Meteor is not an application platform.  It is a fullstack Javascript framework that lets you develop a client and server and do some code-sharing between them.  For additional information of how a Meteor project is structured, see [here](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html).

This is fundamentally different than Ubiquitous Objects, which is an application platform.  In Ubiquitous Objects, functions are first-class citizens, and you create a single function definition that is then synchronized to the client for execution.
